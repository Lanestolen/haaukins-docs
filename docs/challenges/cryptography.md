# Cryptography

The main goal is usually to crack or clone cryptographic objects or algorithms to reach the flag.

### Difficulty Levels

The levels of difficulty scale is based on the number of steps required in order to solve the
Training Challenge

- __Very Easy​:__ It requires just one step in order to get the flag
- __Easy:__​ It requires one-two steps, it is based on the challenge category
- __Medium​:__ It requires two-three steps, it is based on the challenge category
- __Hard:__ ​It requires three-four steps based on the challenge category
- __Very Hard:__​ It requires several steps in order to get the flag


## JS Crypto Client

**Points:** ​ 5 **Difficulty:** Easy

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understanding of cryptography algorithms
- 
**Description:** ​The challenge is based on ​a rotation of the Caesar’s cipher encryption.
Challenge includes only index.html file which contains the encrypted flag through some JS
code.

**Prerequisite:**
- Know how Caesar’s cipher encryption techniques works
