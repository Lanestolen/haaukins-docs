# Reverse Engineering

 It is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code,
 bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.


### Difficulty Levels

The levels of difficulty scale is based on the number of steps required in order to solve the
Training Challenge

- __Very Easy​:__ It requires just one step in order to get the flag
- __Easy:__​ It requires one-two steps, it is based on the challenge category
- __Medium​:__ It requires two-three steps, it is based on the challenge category
- __Hard:__ ​It requires three-four steps based on the challenge category
- __Very Hard:__​ It requires several steps in order to get the flag


## Weird Code

**Points:** ​ 5 **Difficulty:** ​Very Easy

**Learning Objectives:**

- Learn the basic syntax of Go Programming language
- 
**Description:** ​This is a Code-base challenge in which the user will have access to an FTP
server in order to download a source code file. The user have to gather the piece of flag
spreaded over the tricky source code in order to solve the challenge.

**Prerequisite:**
- Basic concepts of a programming language

## Program Behaviour

**Points:** ​ 10 **Difficulty:** ​Medium

**Learning Objectives:**

- Learn how to crack a program
- 
**Description:** ​This is a simple reverse engineering challenge in which the users will have
access to an FTP server in order to download a binary file containing the flag. The main goal
of the challenge is to let understand the user how to crack a program in order to change its
behaviour. It will be necessary to use a debugger tool to analyse and understand the
workflow on the program.

**Prerequisite:**
- Know how to use a debugger tool
- Basic knowledge of Assembly and CPU registers
